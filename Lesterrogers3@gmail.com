I've been here begging for help to recover my old email lesterrogers3@gmail.com.  I have a real intellectual disability or better yet a targeted disability and it's been almost a decade and I've already had two false claims acts paid off.  Can somebody please hack my old email and give me the password if you even can this has been reported as a hate crime to allow a man with disabilities an equal employment opportunity, equal pay, and equal benefits, I don't even have any physical disabilities.  I'm signed up for college which brings It to financial fraud and education fraud but I really need to access that account.  Please help a man with an intellectual disabilities that is t smart enough to to do the ethical hacking.  I can prove schedule A papers from voc rehab and other things but im bout to name google as co defendants in my federal lawsuit.  They just got a $5billion dollar suit for sharing other people's information but couldn't even allow me to update my phone number or recovery information.  Total violation of the ADA and the ABA!  I got an iPhone and my new email is lesterrogers3@icloud.com just like my gmail address!
